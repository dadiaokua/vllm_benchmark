  "I'm trying to figure out how to call the whisper api when a new ticket is created and add the transcription to the ticket. I can do this with a script on the server monitoring the attachments directory, if a new .mp3 is added it will call the whisper api and then send an email to the ticketing with the same subject \"New voicemail from NUMBER\" so its merged into the original ticket... its a bit of a hack.\n\nAt first I was thinking maybe a stored procedure in the database, but I'm just reading through the OSTicket code on Github and it looks like it would make a lot more sense to just add this call + ticket update to the php code... what I don't know is what php code runs when a new ticket is created via email, figured I'd ask here as someone has likely figured this out already.Share Prompt",
